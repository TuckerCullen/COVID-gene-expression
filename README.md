# COVID-gene-expression ðŸ§¬ðŸ˜·
Predicting COVID-19 severity using machine learning on gene expression data.

This is a project I worked on during the fall of 2020 with two other BME/CS students at the University of Virginia. Our goal was to get experience using common machine learning classifiers and visualization techniques through analyzing gene expression data collected from patients who had COVID-19. We employed a variety of ML techniques including PCA, tSNE, LASSO Regression, and SVM. 

The ipython notebook in this repo contains the code for our ML models along with some documention, while the ML_COVID_Gene_Expression_Report PDF is a write up of our results.
